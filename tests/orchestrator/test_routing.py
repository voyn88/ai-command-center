#: The executors the worker can actually run, read from the SAME table the
#: worker itself gates on (`handlers._run_agent` refuses any executor absent
#: from it) rather than restated here. Restating it was the earlier shape and
#: it had a latent flaw: two lists that must agree but nothing forcing them
#: to, so a matrix entry could be "proven" by editing a test constant while
#: no argv builder existed. Deriving it means an executor can only enter the
#: matrix by actually becoming runnable -- a phantom link would not fail
#: loudly (the unavailability path advances the cascade, silently burning one
#: attempt of every task's budget), so the check has to be structural.
